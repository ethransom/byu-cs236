# Sets

### Turns out they're really complicated

Logical operators:

	AND: ∧
	OR:  ∨
	NOT: ¬

For sets, NOT is the compliment, indicated by an overbar.

Moar notation:

	ELEMENT OF: ∈
	EMPTY SET: Ø // also: {}

Set builder notation:

	set = { [elements] | [conditions to filter elements] }

	foo = { x | x is yolo }

	Z  = { ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }
	Z+ = { x | x ∈ Z ∧ x > 0 } // all positive members of Z

## Subsets
	
	SUBSET: ⊆ 

A ⊆ B <-> ∀x (x ∈ A -> x ∈ B)

A is a subset of b IFF (for all x, if x is in a, it is in b)

def subset(a, b)
	x.each do |i|
		if a.contains(i)
			return false unless b.contains(i)
		end
	end
	
	return true
end

In English: A is a subset of B iff all of A's elements are in B.

## Proper subset

Proper subset: A is proper subset of B if all of A is in B, but there are some B not in A

The empty set is a subset (and proper subset) of all sets.

## Power sets:

Run a set through this function to get it's power set:

A = {2, 4, 6}
P(A) = {{}, {2}, {4}, {6},
	{2, 4}, {2, 6}, {4, 6},
	{2, 4, 6}}

	|A| = 3, |P(A)| = 2^|A| = 2^3 = 8

Length of power set is 2^length(set)

# Tuple

Ordered set. Indicated with parens instead of braces.

(a, b) ≠ (b, a)

Cartesian product:

A = {2, 4, 6}, B = {2, 6}

A x B = {(2, 2), (2, 6), (4, 2), (4, 6), (6, 2), (6, 6)}

|A x B| = |A| * |B| = 6

((A x B) x C) ≠ (A x (B x C))
