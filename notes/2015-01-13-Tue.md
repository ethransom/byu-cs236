## Formal Definition of a Function

	f : A -> B

Where:

f is name
: denotes function
A is the domain
B is the co-domain

The above function in C++:

	f (A a) {
		// do stuff
	}

==============================

double g(int a, int b) {
	// foobar
}

In math:

	g : Z x Z -> R

Z x Z = cartesian product = set of all 2-tuples of integers = { (1,1), (3,4), ...}

> Unlike Mathland, IRLand has state. 

## Range

Range(f) = {x ∈ B | E a ∈ A (f(a) = x)}  

English: all values that the function can produce

## Relation

> Taking notes this way is a major bottleneck.

## One-to-one (injective)

f(a) = f(b) iff a = b

English: Every unique input has a unique input.

## Onto (surjective)

A function is onto if the range equals the co-domain.

## Onto and one-to-one (bijective)
