# Predicates and Quantifiers

	All students love pizza.
	Bob is a student.
	Therefore, Bob loves pizza.

How might we prove this?

	1. A
	2. B
	.
	.
	.
	7. C

We seem to be stuck. (TODO: Are we really?)

## Enter predicates...

	B STUDENT(BOB)

Predicate: function that returns a boolean.

Universal quantifier: ∀

∀x STUDENT(x): every x is a student

Existential quantifier: ∃

"There exists"

∃x student(x): predicate is true for at least one value in domain (at least one x is a student)

## Examples

Domain: {Bob, Jim, Joe}.

Given:
	son(Bob, Jim)
	son(Jim, Joe)

What is:

	(all X) son(Jim, X)	= false
	(all X) not son(Jim, X) = false
	(all X) not son(X, Bob) = true

Does the order of quantifiers matter? YES
